Town Square
The Town Square stretches out in front of you. There are 10 or 20 unremarkable buildings that you couldn't care less about. South of you is the Mad Scientist's House. West, a hole in the wall leads into the Abandoned Warehouse. North of here, the town thins out.

You can see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.
