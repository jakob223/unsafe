Mad Scientist's house
A house filled with so many useless gadgets the like of which you've never seen. There are tubes, filling two thirds of the room. High up on the wall there is a shelf. Taking up one entire wall of the room is an enormous amplifier.

On the tool shelf are a small tool box (closed) and a bottle of soylent.

You can also see a ladder and the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.
