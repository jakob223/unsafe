The boom gates are closing, it looks like a train is coming. You drive around them and toward the train station. As you go past them, a train comes and runs you over. That was really dumb.
You've reached one of this game's 14 endings! In that game you used 39 moves. The optimal number of moves is 39.
Great job, you got the optimal number of moves!

You get out of the time machine.

Mad Science Laboratory
You can see a ladder and a time machine (in which are a red button and a coin slot (closed)) here.

&gt;[24] d

Mad Scientist's house
A house filled with so many useless gadgets the like of which you've never seen. There are tubes, filling two thirds of the room. High up on the wall there is a shelf. Taking up one entire wall of the room is an enormous amplifier.

On the tool shelf are a small tool box (closed) and a bottle of soylent.

You can also see a ladder and the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.

&gt;[25] n

Town Square
The Town Square stretches out in front of you. There are 10 or 20 unremarkable buildings that you couldn't care less about. South of you is the Mad Scientist's House. West, a hole in the wall leads into the Abandoned Warehouse. North of here, the town thins out.

You can see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.

&gt;[26] w

Abandoned Warehouse
The warehouse is old and abandoned. It is big and extends south. Not much more to say. The Road is to the North. The Tunnel of Extraction is below. There are holes in the wall to the East and West.

You can see The Tunnel of Extraction here.

&gt;[27] w

Clearing
It's very clear here. The edge of the woods is to the west. A hole that leads into the abandoned warehouse is to the east. There's a stream to the north.

&gt;[28] w

Edge of the Woods
The woods start here and extend to the west. There's a clearing to the east.

&gt;[29] w

Woods
There's lots of trees, in particular, an ash tree, an elm tree, and a pine tree. The edge of the woods is to the east. Going south, you can see signs for a hunting lodge.

You can see a grizzly bear here.

&gt;[30] s

Hunting Grounds
Where hunters hunt things, as long as it's the right season. The woods are to the north. You can head into the Hunting Lodge to the south.

You can see the hunting lodge entrance here.

&gt;[31] open entrance
That's already open.

&gt;[32] s

Hunting Lodge
Where hunters rest or something. One wall is covered in animal heads - a deer, a moose, a lion(!). Kinda creepy, to be honest. The exit is north.

You can see the hunting lodge entrance, a moose head, a deer head, a lion head and a poster here.

&gt;[33] get moose head
Taken.

&gt;[34] wear moose head
You put on the moose head.

&gt;[35] n
Wow, you nearly fell over. Walking while wearing a taxidermied moose head is hard. Maybe try that again?

&gt;[36] n
You go into the hunting grounds, foolishly forgetting that there is a moose head atop your own. The hunters waste no time before shooting you.. at least you got a quick death.
You've reached one of this game's 14 endings! In that game you used 75 moves. The optimal number of moves is 36.
You can reach this ending more quickly!

&gt;[4] w

Road
It's a road, like what people travel on. The outskirts of town are to the east. To the North you can see a fork in the road. The stream is west.

&gt;[5] n

Further Along the Road
More road! There's a fork in the road here. The main road goes North and South. To the West there's a parking lot.

&gt;[6] pull fork

&gt;[7] take fork
Taken.

&gt;[8] s

Road

You can see The Tunnel of Extraction here.

&gt;[10] d

Basement
The dark basement of your house. The hall is upstairs. The Tunnel of Extraction is to the west.

You can see The Tunnel of Extraction and a vat (closed) here.

&gt;[11] u

Hall
The hall in the middle of your house. Your bedroom is to the West. The staircase leading upwards is to the North. The back entryway is to the South. The kitchen is to the East. There is a muddy brown key hanging from a hook on the wall. You can also go down to the basement from here.

&gt;[14] open middle drawer
You open the middle drawer, revealing a big tupperware.

&gt;[15] open big tupperware
You open the big tupperware, revealing a loaf of bread.

&gt;[16] get bread
Taken.

&gt;[17] unwrap bread
You take off the plastic wrap and now the bread smells heavenly.

&gt;[19] put bread in toaster
You put a slice of bread in the toaster.

&gt;[20] put bread in toaster
You put a slice of bread in the toaster.

&gt;[21] press button
The bread recedes into the toaster, and the coils start to light up red. In just a minute, you'll have some tasty tasty toast.

&gt;[22] wait
Time passes.

&gt;[23] wait
Time passes.

DING! The toast is ready. The toaster pops it out but malfunctions and the toast becomes stuck in the toaster.

&gt;[24] put fork in toaster
You stick the fork in the toaster, hoping it will help you remove your toast. Unfortunately, the toaster is electrified and as soon as your fork touches the coil you are electrocuted. You'll never get to eat that delicious toast... :(

The Town Square stretches out in front of you. There are 10 or 20 unremarkable buildings that you couldn't care less about. South of you is the Mad Scientist's House. West, a hole in the wall leads into the Abandoned Warehouse. North of here, the town thins out.

You can see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.
