One approach is to present you with a menu -- when you meet someone, you can choose what to say from a list of phrases or questions. &#x000A;&#x000A;Other games leave the interaction up to you. The game tells you that there's another person in the room, and then presents you with the usual command prompt.

(The comma is important.) For example, to answer a question, you could type "morgan, yes" or "morgan, no". Saying "pirate, hello" can begin an interesting conversation -- or a deadly one. To order someone around, you could use a command like "jeeves, get my umbrella" or "ensign rosen, stop the ship".

    <result xml:space="preserve">&#x000A;Every text adventure is different. But here are some simple ideas which will help you in nearly any game. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Examine everything. (Type "examine" for more on this command.) Even if there are many things in the room, try to examine each one, at least once. Be systematic. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Notice which objects the game is focussing your attention on, and which seem to be background or scenery. (If it looks like the most important thing in the room, it probably is. If the game says it's not important, it probably isn't.) &#x000A;&#x000A;* Try to interact with things. Use common sense. If you see a button, push it. If you find a flute, play it. And "take" anything that you can possibly lift. &#x000A;&#x000A;* If you try a command on an object, and you get a distinctive response, your ears should perk up. It means you're on the right track. Maybe you have to try a related command, or change something else in the environment, or bring a second object in somehow. Maybe you won't be able to complete the action until later in the game. But it's important. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Notice when the game is leading you towards a specific command. If the game says "You could probably bend the bars," then "bend bars" is worth trying. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Pay attention to common elements. If you find rubies and emeralds, look for red and green places to sell, put, or drop them. If a machine is made of brass, look for a brass part to add to it. If a door is barred by shimmering silver light, look for anything that magically glows with a similar light. &#x000A;&#x000A;* When you find something which moves by itself, hang out and watch it for a while. You may need to understand its entire range of movement. &#x000A;&#x000A;And remember, the game world is a world. It has its own logic -- whimsy or dream logic perhaps, but still sense. Find the game's time and reason, and follow it. You will find a way through.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">&#x000A;Every text adventure is different. But here are some simple ideas which will help you in nearly any game. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Examine everything. (Type "examine" for more on this command.) Even if there are many things in the room, try to examine each one, at least once. Be systematic. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Notice which objects the game is focussing your attention on, and which seem to be background or scenery. (If it looks like the most important thing in the room, it probably is. If the game says it's not important, it probably isn't.) &#x000A;&#x000A;* Try to interact with things. Use common sense. If you see a button, push it. If you find a flute, play it. And "take" anything that you can possibly lift. &#x000A;&#x000A;* If you try a command on an object, and you get a distinctive response, your ears should perk up. It means you're on the right track. Maybe you have to try a related command, or change something else in the environment, or bring a second object in somehow. Maybe you won't be able to complete the action until later in the game. But it's important. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Notice when the game is leading you towards a specific command. If the game says "You could probably bend the bars," then "bend bars" is worth trying. &#x000A;&#x000A;* Pay attention to common elements. If you find rubies and emeralds, look for red and green places to sell, put, or drop them. If a machine is made of brass, look for a brass part to add to it. If a door is barred by shimmering silver light, look for anything that magically glows with a similar light. &#x000A;&#x000A;* When you find something which moves by itself, hang out and watch it for a while. You may need to understand its entire range of movement. &#x000A;&#x000A;And remember, the game world is a world. It has its own logic -- whimsy or dream logic perhaps, but still sense. Find the game's time and reason, and follow it. You will find a way through.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
