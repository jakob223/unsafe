As you walk into the woods, a large grizzly bear shows up, baring (bear-ing?) its teeth at you. You hastily take three steps back.

You can see the shed (closed) here.

Space Center
Your friendly neighborhood space center. They build rockets and stuff. The outskirts of town are South, the launch pad is North.

&gt;[5] n

Launch Pad

 The world around you starts to disappear into the smoke emmitted from the rocket engine. You feel yourself pressed into the seat as the spaceship lifts off toward the sky. 

The computer says "This ship is equipped with an auto spacesuit. Simply say SUIT UP and the ship will automatically put your space suit on you so you can go out into space."

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

&gt;[14] wait
Time passes.

The VERY LOW FUEL light blinks on in the corner of the dashboard.

&gt;[16] wait
Time passes.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
The ship barrels toward the ground at an alarming rate.
