Edge of the Woods
The woods start here and extend to the west. There's a clearing to the east.

&gt;[10] w
As you walk into the woods, a large grizzly bear shows up, baring (bear-ing?) its teeth at you. You hastily take three steps back.
The bear seems to be guarding the entrance to the woods. Seems like it would be awfully difficult to get through here unless the bear were somehow distracted. With food, maybe?

&gt;[11] throw fish
You throw the fish to the west. The bear looks at the fish curiously.

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The bear finally decides to eat the fish, in a big gulp.

Time passes.

The bear rubs its belly sleepily. Maybe it'll fall asleep soon.

Time passes.

The bear flops onto its full stomach and starts snoring.

Woods
There's lots of trees, in particular, an ash tree, an elm tree, and a pine tree. The edge of the woods is to the east. Going south, you can see signs for a hunting lodge. You can hear a faint sound from above.

A house filled with so many useless gadgets the like of which you've never seen. There are tubes, filling two thirds of the room. High up on the wall there is a shelf. Taking up one entire wall of the room is an enormous amplifier.

On the high-up shelf are a small tool box (closed) and a bottle of soylent.

You can also see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance and a ladder here.

Town Square
The Town Square stretches out in front of you. There are 10 or 20 unremarkable buildings that you couldn't care less about. South of you is the Mad Scientist's House. West, a hole in the wall leads into the Abandoned Warehouse. North of here, the town thins out.

You can see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.

The Garden
A small garden. There are a few different kinds of flowers and a few different kinds of squash. It's a peaceful place. A spigot on the wall sits above a circular indent in the dirt.

You can see the shed (closed) here.

&gt;[5] n

Launch Pad
The place where rockets take off from. The rest of the Space Center is South.

(to the computer)
The dialog on the screen goes away. The screen now reads READY FOR LAUNCH.

&gt;[11] press launch
The computer counts down: "3... 2... 1... LAUNCHING". 

 The world around you starts to disappear into the smoke emmitted from the rocket engine. You feel yourself pressed into the seat as the spaceship lifts off toward the sky. 

The computer says "This ship is equipped with an auto spacesuit. Simply say SUIT UP and the ship will automatically put your space suit on you so you can go out into space."

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The computer announces: "Auto pilot has engaged. Say CANCEL to fly the ship yourself. Auto pilot has detected that the fuel level is low and will land the ship momentarily."

&gt;[13] say cancel
(to the computer)
The autopilot is disabled.

&gt;[14] wait
Time passes.

The VERY LOW FUEL light blinks on in the corner of the dashboard.

&gt;[15] wait
Time passes.

With a putter then a WHOOSH, the ship runs out of fuel. You don't have much choice but to grip the controls and try to fly it like a plane.

&gt;[16] wait
Time passes.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
The ship barrels toward the ground at an alarming rate.

Ruins of the Tunnel of Extraction
With a CRASH and a BOOM the ship crash lands into the ground. It breaks through the ground and as you die on impact you vaguely recognize your surroundings: this was formerly part of the Tunnel of Extraction.

You stick the fork in the toaster, hoping it will help you remove your toast. Unfortunately, the toaster is electrified and as soon as your fork touches the coil you are electrocuted. You'll never get to eat that delicious toast... :(

You've reached one of this game's 14 endings! In that game you used 24 moves. The optimal number of moves is 24.
Great job, you got the optimal number of moves!

Taken.

&gt;[34] wear moose head
You put on the moose head.

&gt;[35] n
Wow, you nearly fell over. Walking while wearing a taxidermied moose head is hard. Maybe it'll go better if you try that again now that you have your balance?

&gt;[36] n
You go into the hunting grounds, foolishly forgetting that there is a moose head atop your own. The hunters waste no time before shooting you.. at least you got a quick death.
