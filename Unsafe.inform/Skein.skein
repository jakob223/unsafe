Bedroom
It's your bedroom. It's not very interesting. The hall is to the East. The side door (closed) leads out of the house to the West. 

You've just gotten out of your bed, having woken up from a nap.

On the nightstand is an iPod.

&gt;[7] w
You go through the long and winding Tunnel of Extraction.

Abandoned Warehouse
The warehouse is old and abandoned. It is big and extends south. Not much more to say. The Road is to the North. The Tunnel of Extraction is below. There are holes in the wall to the East and West.

You can see The Tunnel of Extraction here.

&gt;[8] w

Clearing
It's very clear here. The edge of the woods is to the west. A hole that leads into the abandoned warehouse is to the east. There's a stream to the north.

&gt;[9] w

Edge of the Woods
The woods start here and extend to the west. There's a clearing to the east.

&gt;[10] w
As you walk into the woods, a large grizzly bear shows up, baring (bear-ing?) its teeth at you. You hastily take three steps back.
The bear seems to be guarding the entrance to the woods. Seems like it would be awfully difficult to get through here unless the bear were somehow distracted. With food, maybe?

&gt;[11] throw fish
You throw the fish to the west. The bear looks at the fish curiously.

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The bear finally decides to eat the fish, in a big gulp.

&gt;[13] wait
Time passes.

The bear rubs its belly sleepily. Maybe it'll fall asleep soon.

&gt;[14] wait
Time passes.

The bear flops onto its full stomach and starts snoring.

The warehouse is old and abandoned. It is big and extends south. Not much more to say. The Road is to the North. The Tunnel of Extraction is below. There are holes in the wall to the East and West.

You can see The Tunnel of Extraction here.

&gt;[17] n

Road
It's a road, like what people travel on. The outskirts of town are to the east. To the North you can see a fork in the road. The stream is west.

&gt;[18] e

Outskirts of Town
There's less town here than there is to the South. The garden is east. The space center is North. The road is West.

&gt;[19] n

Space Center
Your friendly neighborhood space center. They build rockets and stuff. The outskirts of town are South, the launch pad is North.

&gt;[20] n

Launch Pad
The place where rockets take off from. The rest of the Space Center is South.

You can see a spaceship here.

&gt;[21] put fuel in ship
You pour the rocket fuel into the ship's fuel hatch, closing the hatch when you are done.
As if in a gesture of thanks, the computer opens the door to the spaceship for you.

&gt;[22] get in ship
You get into the spaceship.

In the spaceship you can see an ON button, a LAUNCH button, a spacesuit and a helmet.

&gt;[23] close door
You close the spaceship.

&gt;[24] press on
You press the ON button. All around you dials spin and lights blink.

&gt;[25] press launch
The computer counts down: "3... 2... 1... LAUNCHING". 

 The world around you starts to disappear into the smoke emmitted from the rocket engine. You feel yourself pressed into the seat as the spaceship lifts off toward the sky. 

The computer says "This ship is equipped with an auto spacesuit. Simply say SUIT UP and the ship will automatically put your space suit on you so you can go out into space."

&gt;[26] say suit up
(to the computer)
The spaceship's machinery puts a space suit on you faster than you could possibly have done it yourself.

The spaceship has reached space. It's full of stars! It's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen! Now what?

&gt;[27] open door
You open the spaceship.

&gt;[28] get out
You get out of the spaceship.

outer space
You can see a spaceship here.

&gt;[29] take off helmet
You see space, with your own eyes. It's stunningly beautiful. Then your head explodes.

Mad Scientist's House
A house filled with so many useless gadgets the like of which you've never seen. There are tubes, filling two thirds of the room. High up on the wall there is a shelf. Taking up one entire wall of the room is an enormous amplifier.

On the high-up shelf are a small tool box (closed) and a bottle of soylent.

You can also see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance and a ladder here.

Town Square
The Town Square stretches out in front of you. There are 10 or 20 unremarkable buildings that you couldn't care less about. South of you is the Mad Scientist's House. West, a hole in the wall leads into the Abandoned Warehouse. North of here, the town thins out.

You can see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.

It's a road, like what people travel on. The outskirts of town are to the east. To the North you can see a fork in the road. The stream is west. The warehouse is south.

The computer counts down: "3... 2... 1... LAUNCHING". 

 The world around you starts to disappear into the smoke emmitted from the rocket engine. You feel yourself pressed into the seat as the spaceship lifts off toward the sky. 

The computer says "This ship is equipped with an auto spacesuit. Simply say SUIT UP and the ship will automatically put your space suit on you so you can go out into space."

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The computer announces: "Auto pilot has engaged. Say CANCEL to fly the ship yourself. Auto pilot has detected that the fuel level is low and will land the ship momentarily."

The VERY LOW FUEL light blinks on in the corner of the dashboard.

You've just gotten out of your bed, having woken up from a nap.

On the nightstand is an iPod.

A dialog appears on the screen: WARNING: LOW FUEL. SAY "confirm" to continue. Mission abort HIGHLY recommended.

(to the computer)
The dialog on the screen goes away. The screen now reads READY FOR LAUNCH.

&gt;[11] press launch
The computer counts down: "3... 2... 1... LAUNCHING". 

 The world around you starts to disappear into the smoke emmitted from the rocket engine. You feel yourself pressed into the seat as the spaceship lifts off toward the sky. 

The computer says "This ship is equipped with an auto spacesuit. Simply say SUIT UP and the ship will automatically put your space suit on you so you can go out into space."

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The computer announces: "Auto pilot has engaged. Say CANCEL to fly the ship yourself. Auto pilot has detected that the fuel level is low and will land the ship momentarily."

(to the computer)
The autopilot is disabled.

&gt;[14] wait
Time passes.

The VERY LOW FUEL light blinks on in the corner of the dashboard.

&gt;[15] wait
Time passes.

With a putter then a WHOOSH, the ship runs out of fuel. You don't have much choice but to grip the controls and try to fly it like a plane.

&gt;[16] wait
Time passes.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
The ship barrels toward the ground at an alarming rate.

&gt;[17] wait
Time passes.

Ruins of the Tunnel of Extraction
With a CRASH and a BOOM the ship crash lands into the ground. It breaks through the ground and as you die on impact you vaguely recognize your surroundings: this was formerly part of the Tunnel of Extraction.

The Garden
A small garden. There are a few different kinds of flowers and a few different kinds of squash. It's a peaceful place. A spigot on the wall sits above a circular indent in the dirt. You could swear there used to be a bucket somewhere around here, but you don't see it anywhere...

The side door to your house is East, and a path leads off towards town to the West.

You can see the shed (closed) here.

The Garden
A small garden. There are a few different kinds of flowers and a few different kinds of squash. It's a peaceful place. A spigot on the wall sits above a circular indent in the dirt. You could swear there used to be a bucket somewhere around here, but you don't see it anywhere...

The side door to your house is East, and a path leads off towards town to the West.

The Garden
A small garden. There are a few different kinds of flowers and a few different kinds of squash. It's a peaceful place. A spigot on the wall sits above a circular indent in the dirt. You could swear there used to be a bucket somewhere around here, but you don't see it anywhere...

The side door to your house is East, and a path leads off towards town to the West.

You can see the shed (closed) here.

The Garden
A small garden. There are a few different kinds of flowers and a few different kinds of squash. It's a peaceful place. A spigot on the wall sits above a circular indent in the dirt. You could swear there used to be a bucket somewhere around here, but you don't see it anywhere...

The side door to your house is East, and a path leads off towards town to the West.

You can see the shed (closed) here.

"look": Look around the room. 

(You can abbreviate this as "l".) 

Take a look around. This repeats the description of the room, and lists everything you see nearby. 

If you are having trouble understanding where you are, or what's going on in the game, it never hurts to "look". 

Remember, you also can "examine" anything you see, to inspect it in more detail.

These commands let you move around. You will walk out of the room, and into a nearby room, in the given direction. 

If the game replies "You can't go that way," then there is no exit in that direction. Try "look" to see what directions you can go.

Every text adventure is different. But here are some simple ideas which will help you in nearly any game. 

* Examine everything. (Type "examine" for more on this command.) Even if there are many things in the room, try to examine each one, at least once. Be systematic. 

* Notice which objects the game is focussing your attention on, and which seem to be background or scenery. (If it looks like the most important thing in the room, it probably is. If the game says it's not important, it probably isn't.) 

* Try to interact with things. Use common sense. If you see a button, push it. If you find a flute, play it. And "take" anything that you can possibly lift. 

* If you try a command on an object, and you get a distinctive response, your ears should perk up. It means you're on the right track. Maybe you have to try a related command, or change something else in the environment, or bring a second object in somehow. Maybe you won't be able to complete the action until later in the game. But it's important. 

* Notice when the game is leading you towards a specific command. If the game says "You could probably bend the bars," then "bend bars" is worth trying. 

* Pay attention to common elements. If you find rubies and emeralds, look for red and green places to sell, put, or drop them. If a machine is made of brass, look for a brass part to add to it. If a door is barred by shimmering silver light, look for anything that magically glows with a similar light. 

* When you find something which moves by itself, hang out and watch it for a while. You may need to understand its entire range of movement. 

And remember, the game world is a world. It has its own logic -- whimsy or dream logic perhaps, but still sense. Find the game's time and reason, and follow it. You will find a way through.

Communicating with other characters is a tricky topic. Different games handle it in different ways. One approach is to present you with a menu -- when you meet someone, you can choose what to say from a list of phrases or questions. 

Other games leave the interaction up to you. The game tells you that there's another person in the room, and then presents you with the usual command prompt. The possible commands will vary from game to game, but these are usually available: 

"talk to person" 
"ask person about topic" 
"tell person about topic" 
"say word to person" 
"ask person for thing" 
"give thing to person" 
"show thing to person" 

You can also talk to a person by typing "person, phrase". (The comma is important.) For example, to answer a question, you could type "morgan, yes" or "morgan, no". Saying "pirate, hello" can begin an interesting conversation -- or a deadly one. To order someone around, you could use a command like "jeeves, get my umbrella" or "ensign rosen, stop the ship". (Naturally, not everyone will be willing to obey your commands!)

Bedroom
It's your bedroom. It's not very interesting. The hall is to the East. The side door (closed) leads out of the house to the West. 

You've just gotten out of your bed, having woken up from a nap.

On the nightstand is an iPod.

A lair in which a demonic ritual might be held. There is a table with a pentagram drawn on it. It's the South end of the warehouse; the only exit is North, to the rest of the warehouse.

On the table are a candle and a sacrificial knife.

You can also see a cage (in which is a snake) and an ancient cabinet (in which are two canisters (closed)) here.

The woods start here and extend to the west. There's a clearing to the east.

&gt;[29] w

Woods
There's lots of trees, in particular, an ash tree, an elm tree, and a pine tree. The edge of the woods is to the east. Going south, you can see signs for a hunting lodge. You can hear a faint sound from above.

&gt;[30] s

Hunting Grounds
Where hunters hunt things, as long as it's the right season. The woods are to the north. You can head into the Hunting Lodge to the south.

You can see the hunting lodge entrance here.

&gt;[31] open entrance
You open the hunting lodge entrance.

&gt;[32] s

Hunting Lodge
Where hunters rest or something. One wall is covered in animal heads - a deer, a moose, a lion(!). Kinda creepy, to be honest. The exit is north.

You can see the hunting lodge entrance and a poster here.

&gt;[33] get moose head
Taken.

&gt;[34] wear moose head
You put on the moose head.

&gt;[35] n
Wow, you nearly fell over. Walking while wearing a taxidermied moose head is hard. Maybe it'll go better if you try that again now that you have your balance?

&gt;[36] n
You go into the hunting grounds, foolishly forgetting that there is a moose head atop your own. The hunters waste no time before shooting you.. at least you got a quick death.

You've just gotten out of your bed, having woken up from a nap.

On the nightstand is an iPod.

Mad Science Laboratory
A room full of so much mad science, it makes you mad just to think about it. The wall is covered in chalkboards, and the chalkboards are covered in diagrams, and the diagrams are covered in labels. Maddening.

You can see pie crumbs, a ladder, a time machine and a time safe (closed) here.

Mad Scientist's House
A house filled with so many useless gadgets the like of which you've never seen. There are tubes, filling two thirds of the room. High up on the wall there is a shelf. Taking up one entire wall of the room is an enormous amplifier.

On the high-up shelf are a small tool box (closed) and a bottle of soylent.

You can also see a ladder and the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.

Town Square
The Town Square stretches out in front of you. There are 10 or 20 unremarkable buildings that you couldn't care less about. South of you is the Mad Scientist's House. West, a hole in the wall leads into the Abandoned Warehouse. North of here, the town thins out.
