Clearing
It's very clear here. The edge of the woods is to the west. A hole that leads into the abandoned warehouse is to the east. There's a stream to the north.

Edge of the Woods
The woods start here and extend to the west. There's a clearing to the east.

&gt;[10] w
As you walk into the woods, a large grizzly bear shows up, baring (bear-ing?) its teeth at you. You hastily take three steps back.
The bear seems to be guarding the entrance to the woods. Seems like it would be awfully difficult to get through here unless the bear were somehow distracted. With food, maybe?

&gt;[11] throw fish
You throw the fish to the west. The bear looks at the fish curiously.

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The bear finally decides to eat the fish, in a big gulp.

Time passes.

The bear rubs its belly sleepily. Maybe it'll fall asleep soon.

Time passes.

The bear flops onto its full stomach and starts snoring.

Woods
There's lots of trees, in particular, an ash tree, an elm tree, and a pine tree. The edge of the woods is to the east. Going south, you can see signs for a hunting lodge. You can hear a faint sound from above.

Town Square
The Town Square stretches out in front of you. There are 10 or 20 unremarkable buildings that you couldn't care less about. South of you is the Mad Scientist's House. West, a hole in the wall leads into the Abandoned Warehouse. North of here, the town thins out.

You can see the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.

The Garden
A small garden. There are a few different kinds of flowers and a few different kinds of squash. It's a peaceful place. A spigot on the wall sits above a circular indent in the dirt.

You can see the shed (closed) here.

&gt;[3] w

Outskirts of Town
There's less town here than there is to the South. The garden is east. The space center is North. The road is West.

&gt;[4] n

Space Center
Your friendly neighborhood space center. They build rockets and stuff. The outskirts of town are South, the launch pad is North.

&gt;[5] n

Launch Pad
The place where rockets take off from. The rest of the Space Center is South.

You can see a spaceship here.

&gt;[6] open spaceship

You get into the spaceship.

In the spaceship you can see an ON button, a LAUNCH button, a spacesuit and a helmet.

(to the computer)
The dialog on the screen goes away. The screen now reads READY FOR LAUNCH.

&gt;[11] press launch
The computer counts down: "3... 2... 1... LAUNCHING". 

 The world around you starts to disappear into the smoke emmitted from the rocket engine. You feel yourself pressed into the seat as the spaceship lifts off toward the sky. 

The computer says "This ship is equipped with an auto spacesuit. Simply say SUIT UP and the ship will automatically put your space suit on you so you can go out into space."

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The computer announces: "Auto pilot has engaged. Say CANCEL to fly the ship yourself. Auto pilot has detected that the fuel level is low and will land the ship momentarily."

&gt;[13] say cancel
(to the computer)
The autopilot is disabled.

&gt;[14] wait
Time passes.

The VERY LOW FUEL light blinks on in the corner of the dashboard.

&gt;[15] wait
Time passes.

With a putter then a WHOOSH, the ship runs out of fuel. You don't have much choice but to grip the controls and try to fly it like a plane.

&gt;[16] wait
Time passes.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
The ship barrels toward the ground at an alarming rate.

Ruins of the Tunnel of Extraction
With a CRASH and a BOOM the ship crash lands into the ground. It breaks through the ground and as you die on impact you vaguely recognize your surroundings: this was formerly part of the Tunnel of Extraction.
