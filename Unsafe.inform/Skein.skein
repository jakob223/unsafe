As you walk into the woods, a large grizzly bear shows up, baring (bear-ing?) its teeth at you. You hastily take three steps back.

The Garden
A small garden. There are a few different kinds of flowers and a few different kinds of squash. It's a peaceful place. A spigot on the wall sits above a circular indent in the dirt.

You can see the shed (closed) here.

Space Center
Your friendly neighborhood space center. They build rockets and stuff. The outskirts of town are South, the launch pad is North.

&gt;[5] n

Launch Pad
The place where rockets take off from. The rest of the Space Center is South.

 The world around you starts to disappear into the smoke emmitted from the rocket engine. You feel yourself pressed into the seat as the spaceship lifts off toward the sky. 

The computer says "This ship is equipped with an auto spacesuit. Simply say SUIT UP and the ship will automatically put your space suit on you so you can go out into space."

&gt;[12] wait
Time passes.

The autopilot is disabled.

&gt;[14] wait
Time passes.

The VERY LOW FUEL light blinks on in the corner of the dashboard.

With a putter then a WHOOSH, the ship runs out of fuel. You don't have much choice but to grip the controls and try to fly it like a plane.

&gt;[16] wait
Time passes.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
The ship barrels toward the ground at an alarming rate.

Mad Science Laboratory
A room full of so much mad science, it makes you mad just to think about it. The wall is covered in chalkboards, and the chalkboards are covered in diagrams, and the diagrams are covered in labels. Maddening.

You can see pie crumbs, a ladder, a time machine and a time safe (closed) here.

Mad Scientist's House
A house filled with so many useless gadgets the like of which you've never seen. There are tubes, filling two thirds of the room. High up on the wall there is a shelf. Taking up one entire wall of the room is an enormous amplifier.

On the high-up shelf are a small tool box (closed) and a bottle of soylent.

You can also see a ladder and the Mad Scientist's Grand Entrance here.
